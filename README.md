# Unit Converter 

A demo application made with React and Bootstrap.

## What it Does

The unit converter allows the user to enter a numeric value and select an input type and automatically convert it to one or more output types. 

Additional output types can be selected via a drop down box and added with the corrosponding button. Once added to the output list, the values will automatically update when the input value is changed. Output types can be removed by clicking on them.
